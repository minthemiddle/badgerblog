# Badger Blog

Badger Blog is a minimal single-user blog engine based on Laravel and Tailwind CSS. No Javascript. Like for the mascot animal, speed and agility is priority. It is intended to run one blog. 


Badger Blog is inspired by Bearblog, yet does not aspire to have the same features.

## Roadmap

- Planned: Blogger can set date, title and body
- Planned: Blogger can see all their posts
- Planned: Blogger can edit one post
- Planned: Blogger can set post to page type
- Planned: Blogger can add tags to post
- Planned: Blogger can add global key value extra field
- Planned: Detailed installation tutorial
- Planned: 1-click installer for Ploi
- Planned: What you will get (and how much (work) it will be for you)
- Planned: Extra fields via JSON
- Planned: Drag and drop image upload
- Planned: Use only standard Laravel tools
- Planned: Support adding privacy 
- Planned: Simple theming
- Planned: High test coverage
